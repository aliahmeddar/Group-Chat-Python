# Group-Chat-Python
Python(2.7) based simple educational-level Group chat project.

We have implemented a robust Virtual Chat using the concepts of networking paired with socket level programming using Python 2.7. 
The main working of the virtual chat is established using a TCP connection between multiple clients (users) and a single server for handling the transactions between them. The users would be able to communicate in real-time, send text messages as well as transfer files throughout the network.
